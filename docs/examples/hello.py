"""
hello.py - minimal DAPPS app.

Listens on dapps/in/hello for inbound messages.  For each message, replies
"hello, <name>!" back to the sender, where <name> is the message payload.
Acks every message it processes (idempotently - a redelivery is recognised
by id and acked without sending a duplicate reply).

Designed as the smallest useful demonstration of the DAPPS app interface,
not as production code.  Install paho-mqtt 2.x first:

    pip install paho-mqtt

Run a DAPPS instance locally (default port 1883), then:

    python hello.py

In another terminal, send "world" to yourself with mosquitto_pub:

    mosquitto_pub -h 127.0.0.1 -V mqttv5 \\
        -t 'dapps/out/hello/<your-callsign>' -m 'world'

Replace <your-callsign> with whatever Callsign your DAPPS is configured
with - the reply will loop back to you.
