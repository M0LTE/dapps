"""
chat.py — small group-chat app over DAPPS.

Subscribes to dapps/in/chat for incoming lines; broadcasts whatever you
type at the prompt to a fixed list of recipient callsigns. Each
recipient runs the same script, with its own copy of the recipient list
(no central registry — DAPPS doesn't have one).

Usage:

    python chat.py G7XYZ M0LTE-1 GB7AAA-4

The CLI args are the *other* people you want to talk to. This script's
own callsign is whichever Callsign the local DAPPS is configured with —
it's stamped onto outbound messages by DAPPS, so you don't need to pass
it here.

What this demonstrates:
  - One-to-many fan-out (one publish per recipient — DAPPS doesn't have
    multicast at the app layer; you address each peer explicitly).
  - Reading dapps-source to display "who said what."
  - Idempotent redelivery: two arrivals of the same id print only once.

Like hello.py, this is a teaching example, not production code. The
"seen" set is in memory; restart the script and you'll re-print the
backlog. For a real app, persist it.
