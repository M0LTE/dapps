/// MeshCore-flavoured DSR-with-passive-discovery. Two complementary
/// mechanisms:
///
/// <list type="number">
/// <item>Source-routed delivery: when this node has a discovered
///   path to the destination, the path is embedded in the outbound
///   <see cref="BackhaulMessage.SourceRoute"/>. Each downstream hop
///   pulls its next neighbour from the head of the list and strips
///   it before re-encoding - no per-hop routing decision needed
///   along the path. When a source-routed message arrives at a
///   forwarder, it just relays along the prescribed route.</item>
/// <item>Flood discovery: when this node has no path for a
///   destination, it originates a flood with an empty
///   <see cref="BackhaulMessage.TraversedHops"/> list. Each transit
///   node appends its own callsign before re-flooding to neighbours
///   it hasn't already traversed. When a flood arrives at any node,
///   the inbound TraversedHops reversed is the path back to the
///   originator - stored in <see cref="DbDiscoveredPath"/> for
///   future source-routed sends.</item>
/// </list>
///
/// Layered as a decorator: the inner algorithm (typically
/// <see cref="StaticRoutingAlgorithm"/>) ALWAYS wins for resolution
/// - operator overrides and direct neighbours take precedence over
/// discovered paths. Discovered paths are consulted only when inner
/// returns <see cref="RouteDecision.Unreachable"/>; flood-discovery
/// is the final fallback.
///
/// Failure handling: each failed forward against a discovered path
/// increments <see cref="DbDiscoveredPath.ConsecutiveFailures"/>;
/// once it hits <see cref="InvalidationThreshold"/> the row is
/// deleted and the next attempt falls through to flood-discovery.
///
/// Differences from <see cref="FloodFallbackAlgorithm"/>: this one
/// stores the FULL discovered path (not just the next hop), uses
/// the TraversedHops accumulator for loop avoidance during the
/// flood (rather than just excluding the immediate upstream), and
/// re-uses the discovered path for subsequent sends (eliminating
/// the need to flood per-message after first contact).
