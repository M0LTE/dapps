/// hasn't yet been flooded, send to every direct neighbour with a
/// hop budget. Each forwarding hop decrements before re-flooding;
/// per-(message, link-source) deduplication via <see cref="DbFloodSeen"/>
/// stops the flood from looping back.
///
/// Layered as a decorator over the next inner algorithm (typically
/// <see cref="PassiveLearningAlgorithm"/>): if the inner algorithm
/// can resolve the destination, we use that; the flood is the
/// last-resort fallback. Floods that succeed in reaching the
/// destination cause the receiver to send replies back via passive
/// learning (which observed the inbound flood and learned reverse
/// routes) - so floods diminish as the network warms up.
///
/// In-flight flood messages: when a message arrives at this node
/// already in flood mode (<see cref="DbMessage.FloodHopsRemaining"/>
/// is set), <see cref="ResolveAsync"/> handles the propagation
/// regardless of what the inner algorithm thinks - the flood IS the
/// route, and we just need to spread it without circling back to the
